    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <h2>Basic</h2>
    <p><u>Cricket</u> is a popular sport played and loved by millions around the world. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each. The game is known for its exciting format variations, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches. Cricket requires a combination of skill, strategy, and teamwork, with key roles such as batsmen, bowlers, and fielders. The sport is especially popular in countries like India, England, Australia, Pakistan, and South Africa. Cricket not only entertains but also brings nations together, showcasing sportsmanship and national pride.
</p>
    <h2>T20 Format</h2>
    <p><u>The T20 (Twenty20)</u> format is the shortest and most fast-paced version of cricket. Each team plays a single innings limited to 20 overs, making the match last about three hours. This format is known for its high-energy gameplay, big hitting, and thrilling finishes. T20 cricket is very popular among fans for its entertainment value and has given rise to various domestic leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and more. It has brought new audiences to the sport and made cricket more accessible to younger generations.</p>
    <h2>ODI Format</h2>
    <p><u>One Day Internationals (ODIs)</u> are a slightly longer version of the game, with each team allowed to bat for 50 overs. This format strikes a balance between the aggression of T20s and the patience required in Test matches. ODIs require strategic planning, as teams must manage their innings carefully to build a strong score while conserving wickets. The ICC Cricket World Cup, held every four years, is one of the most prestigious tournaments in this format and is watched by millions globally.</p>
    <h2>TEST Format</h2>
    <p><u>Test cricket</u> is the oldest and most traditional format of the game, played over five days with each team having two innings. It is considered the ultimate test of a cricketer's skill, endurance, and mental strength. Unlike the shorter formats, Test matches require players to show patience, consistency, and technique. It is often referred to as the "purest" form of the game, where strategy and individual brilliance shine over a longer period. Despite being slower-paced, Test cricket holds a special place in the hearts of cricket purists.
